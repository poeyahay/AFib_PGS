## Overview

This GitHub repository contains scripts demonstrating how GWAS meta-analysis was performed using [**METAL**](https://github.com/poeyahay/AFib_PGS/tree/main/METAL), how polygenic scores were created using [**SBayesRC**](https://github.com/poeyahay/AFib_PGS/blob/main/SBayesRC/SBRC_Run.sh), and how multiple polygenic scoring files were combined using the [**SBayesRC-multi**](https://github.com/poeyahay/AFib_PGS/blob/main/Multi/SBRCmulti.R) tool (handles two PGS input files) and the [**adapted multi tool**](https://github.com/poeyahay/AFib_PGS/blob/main/Multi/Multi_Tool.R) (handles more than two PGS input files).  

The scripts are related to the manuscript:
*“Multi-trait polygenic risk scores improve genomic prediction of atrial fibrillation across diverse ancestries”*
which was recently submitted to *Nature Communications* ([https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7713077/v1](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7713077/v1)).
