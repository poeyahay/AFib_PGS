## Overview

This GitHub repository contains scripts demonstrating how GWAS meta-analysis was performed using **METAL**, how polygenic scores were created using **SBayesRC**, and how multiple polygenic scoring files were combined using the **SBayesRC-multi** tool (handles two PGS input files) and an adapted multi-tool (handles more than two PGS input files).  

The scripts are related to the manuscript *“Multi-trait polygenic risk scores improve genomic prediction of atrial fibrillation across diverse ancestries”*, recently submitted to *Nature Communications* ([https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7713077/v1](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7713077/v1)).
